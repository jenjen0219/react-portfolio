# Work Portfolio - Websites Implemented with React

## Description
This program is a website that was created with react in order to keep up with industry standards that now partake in the use of react to make websites more efficient. "The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface," (Herbert, 2022). This is Herbert's description of what react is all about and why it's being used in this project to create an appealing portfolio.

Where the code is now, there is still lots more to do in regards to ensuring the smooth functionality across all elements along with their styling. Considering that this is my portfolio, I do have plans on improving upon this code.
