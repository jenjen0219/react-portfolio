                    My name is Jennifer, but I prefer to go by Jenni. I hold a dual degree in Management Information Systems and Marketing from Washington State University. During my studies, I rediscovered my love for coding, which I had first experienced during an HTML web-design course I took a few years prior at Wenatchee Valley College. As of May 1st of 2023, I've completed the UW Fullstack Coding Bootcamp that taught the most up-to date practices in website development.

                    To kick off my career in tech, I opted for an IT focused role to widen my understanding of technological hardware. I'm a data center technician for T-Mobile and although I have been loving getting to work hands-on with technological hardware, I still have a burning passion to pursue software engineering. I feel confident that the bootcamp I attended has provided me with the fundamental tools to tackle on any problem or need that arises.
