    Hello!

<h3>
    My name is Jennifer, but I usually go by Jen. I have a dual degree from Washington State University for Management Informations Systems and Marketing that re-introduced me to coding and reminded me how much fun I had in an HTML web-design course I took a few years back at Wenatchee Valley College. I'm now currently attending the UW Fulllstack Coding Bootcamp with hopes of landing a junior software engineering role in the near future. Until then, I aim to apply what I've learned and help various Latino owned businesses with updating and or impriving upon any appilcations or practices that are otherwise outdated. If you'd like to learn more about my work or of myself in general then feel free to look around my portfolio that I made myself!

    Thanks for visiting!
