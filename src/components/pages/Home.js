                    My name is Jennifer, but I prefer to go by Jen. I hold a dual degree in Management Information Systems and Marketing from Washington State University. During my studies, I rediscovered my love for coding, which I had first experienced during an HTML web-design course I took a few years prior at Wenatchee Valley College. Currently, I am attending the UW Fullstack Coding Bootcamp in pursuit of a junior software engineering role.

                    While I continue to seek employment, I am determined to apply the knowledge I have acquired thus far to help various Latino-owned businesses. My goal is to update or improve their applications and practices that may be outdated. If you would like to learn more about me or my work, please feel free to look around the portfolio that I  personally created using React and Bootstrap!
